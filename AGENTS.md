This file provides guidance to OpenCode when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A lightweight, feature-rich screenshot application built with Wails (Go + React). Capture, annotate, and export screenshots with a beautiful glassmorphism UI.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to analyze user requirements, delegate tasks to appropriate sub-agents, and ensure cohesive delivery of features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Workflows

- Primary workflow: `./.claude/workflows/primary-workflow.md`
- Development rules: `./.claude/workflows/development-rules.md`
- Orchestration protocols: `./.claude/workflows/orchestration-protocol.md`
- Documentation management: `./.claude/workflows/documentation-management.md`
- And other workflows: `./.claude/workflows/*`

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** You must follow strictly the development rules in `./.claude/workflows/development-rules.md` file.
**IMPORTANT:** Before you plan or proceed any implementation, always read the `./README.md` file first to get context.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## Development Principles

- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - avoid over-engineering
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - prefer simple solutions
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminate code duplication

## Documentation

Keep all important docs in `./docs` folder:

```
./docs
├── project-overview-pdr.md
├── code-standards.md
├── codebase-summary.md
├── design-guidelines.md
└── system-architecture.md
```

**IMPORTANT:** *MUST READ* and *MUST COMPLY* all *INSTRUCTIONS* in project `./CLAUDE.md`, especially *WORKFLOWS* section is *CRITICALLY IMPORTANT*, this rule is *MANDATORY. NON-NEGOTIABLE. NO EXCEPTIONS. MUST REMEMBER AT ALL TIMES!!!*
